# Supper-and-Sips
An app to randomly choose dinner and drink recipes.

## Description
Our food ontology and semantic recipe search engine makes it possible to search for recipes using natural language queries, such as "chicken recepies" or just "pasta recepies" or even complicated dishes like "low fat vegan cupcakes".

## Future Iterations
1. Adding more customization with the random selection, i.e. entrée vs dessert
2. Adding an automation on the drink based on the entrée selected
3. Recipe takes you to a video of somebody preparing the meal or drink
4. Print the recipe to pdf or to your own printer
5. Modal options to open a new page or open a print screen
6. Options for customizations for searches for non-alcoholic or vegan/vegatarian options
